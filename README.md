# SQL-Challenge

This analysis involves setting up an employee database for a fictitious "Pewlett Hackard", using the data from the [Employee CSV Files](https://github.com/lmfao415/SQL-Challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/data).

An [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/lmfao415/SQL-Challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeERD.png) was created to illustrate the data relationships.

The data was imported to SQL using this [Table Schemata](https://github.com/lmfao415/SQL-Challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/table_schemata.sql) with various [SQL Queries](https://github.com/lmfao415/SQL-Challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/employee_queries.sql) being used to then analyze the data.

Further analysis involving Pandas and Matplotlib visualization is [available HERE](https://github.com/lmfao415/SQL-Challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/bonus_analysis.ipynb) for which an additional [SQL View](https://github.com/lmfao415/SQL-Challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/bonus_view.sql) was created.
